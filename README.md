# Firefox53ESR-legacy-addons (WIP) created: 2017-10...
-A curated list and XPI files of Mozilla Firefox browser extensions, addons, themes from addons.mozilla.org, before XUL-based purge blackout

-Current state of this (document) is imperfect and RAW as RAW meat, but will be updated (cooked) continuously

-DISCLAIMER


I respect author rights as original source code creator open source licenses, credit etc, but NO about "copyright" literal as "distribution" exclusivity => STATEMENT: I reject totally deeply ( add more adjetives here) the logic: "I kill it, I abandon it because it is my creation", "I kill it because it is mine" this is not acceptable for my as some software has unique and useful social value beyond individual selfish reasons

-WIP (non formatted, yet, bad grammar and typos for sure)

-Why? (reason of this)

Mozilla will be (soon) this November-2017 purge XUL support for addons, force "WebExtensions" only (without being a replacer, non-proper mature technology and disrespectul to community devs (veterans, and loyal supporters) => THIS IS A BAD MOVE, Mozilla

-Objectives (focus)

FirefoxPLaces (bookmarks, history) => key features

XUL customization (bars, sliders, sidebars

-Projects ideas-collaboration

ArchiveTeam fellas (help to bulk archive addons, descriptions and source.code) for further analysis and experiments (useful software)
Integration WaterFox team (WaterFox seems solid at least to support a Firefox 53ESR (pre 56-57 build) with XUL-based legacy addons support
Pale Moon (seems outdated or obsolete, more research is needed)

Any fella who wants contribute 


-Sources

Reddit.com (subreddits: Firefox, Mozilla, WaterFox... etc)
Addons.Mozilla.Org (primary source)
Chrome.Webstore (WebExtensions replacers and Chromium|Blink-alternatives)
Www/mirrors
MozillaZine (Firefox powerUsers community)

FEBE => key feature (must be on stable build as internal non an addon!!!)
SearchPlaces => non replacers yet, even Patch For Library (addon) to edit places.uris is deleted by author on addons.mozilla.org
SortPlaces => ...
SyncPlaces => "replacers" as third party sync (EverSync, Xmarks) and Firefox Sync (aka Firefox Accounts, Firefox Weave)
CheckPlaces => partially replaced with Bookmarks-Organizer
TagShifter => TagSieve
Roomy bar
Form History Control
Cookies
-list of HUGE VALUABLE and "Hall Of Fame" addons that would be purged (XUL-based) when Mozilla Firefox 57 build reach stable deploy

FireFTP 
FireSSH 
DownThemAll => author seems

-Repository structure

original (checksum-friendly) XPI last stable versions if addons, extensions, completeThemes as mirrors (personal list, not "complete list" by now)
maybe CSV (name,version,author,Firefox version compatibility) to manage more easy and a Google Docs SpreadSheet to social collaboration


-Examples of authors killing creations (logic: I kill it because i created it)

-Important bugFixes on Firefox places (bookmarks, history)
... be continued

-PERSONAL Opinion

Chromium, Webkit, Firefox, Mozilla, Opera, all main browsers are in hands of "non be evil" companies, corporations, even Mozilla last moves seems the opposite Philosophy of users and devs first (devs are users too) and XUL-addons are used mostly by powerUsers daily and are powerful enought to deserve proper respect, support and replacing before killing them

There is not a browser development powered by a real P2P community (Chromium Waterfox or Mozilla is at the end corporation-driven), all are forks that follow big brother (in all senses), i think would be great if open source community joins to improve the browser development (in terms of code management, compatibility, customization, performance) etc

-KEY though

When I see, Chromium and Chrome force limitation about remember history (90 days or three months old) i have backups but that makes me angry even today (withut proper advice or notice), some see browser history as a "diary of web browsing" and it is useful for agile bookmarking etc (wihout the compulsive star syndrome of push bookmark button million times) that was a key moment, i realize that i want to preserve my data and control expirations, and prevent "SHIT" and "mess" with my things by "smart app" that though for me and decides for me.

Next key moment is when i realize sync services like Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync even Pinboard(interesting) or Xmarks (creepy) make me dependant of third party services, non zero-knowledge, non privacy-friendly and even bad performance, because if you have bookmarks, urls or history ith about 10k order (n*10k) all seems to work bad

But even bookmarking in browsers is bad, eventually i go to self hosted customized web apps, and my own server, but integration with browser is a need for me (visited links mark, bookmarked links mark etc and sync across devices, mobile etc, so internal sync is a need (but i prefer my own hosted like NextCloud, Owncloud than a Xmarks or EverSync, Firefox Sync solution

PD: Initially this is a "mess" as diffuse graph of chaotic thoughs, but eventually will have many sense

-Observation

This document is a expression of some chaos, ideas and thoughs, but chaos tends to relation and order, so check out in a few weeks and see the light (it is a joke, but RAW state will become "state of art" ;)
