# Firefox53ESR-legacy-addons (WIP) created: 2017-10...
-A curated list and XPI files of Mozilla Firefox browser extensions, addons, themes from addons.mozilla.org, before XUL-based purge blackout

*First and example of what w loose on new software (with deprecated features, and functionality capped)

Firefox Places query syntax
related to "Patch For Library" and "TagSieve" and "SearchPlaces" addons
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=629560

this allow use powerfull tagging in firefox places without external apps or web/apps, locally (is a plus) and using places.sqlite as urls container (easy enought) in addition to this Pinboard Diigo, Delicious (RIP) and others seems to allow some type of tagging and formats, yeah i know exist a very large number of cms-based, proyects, Delicious clones, desktop apps, etc but hey, this is cross platform and is on local desktop browser (easy to mantain) fast enough and connected to browser

tagging is a must-have for me and smartFolders or virtualFolders as "auto.tagging" container too 

*I interested on browsers customization because we use them all the time, the most of the time, and productivity integration with addons and configs is a must have for me in my research and work (so yes, i am a browser poweruser who makes magic with software)

- Addons.Mozilla.Org (AMO for now) state
  aprox 20.900 extensions (addons) 
  aprox 1000 pages with 20 extensions (per.page)
  
  hierarchy curation of "important ones"
  logic: more users (more key feature more value more needed etc) => this is false globally but applies good for relevance => popularity => masses => users volume usage so
  
  most used addon is (by far) Adblock Plus with 14.4M (millions) of users (aprox)
  folloed by Video Download Helper 3.7M (millions) and NoScript 1.7M (millions) of users (aprox) we see that difference is notable even in most used addons (it is know that AdBlock is a demanded "IT friend install me an ad blocker) so etc uBLock is about 4M (millions) this is because "inertia" of "who first arrive" or "veteran" et AdBlock name > uBlock (seems to be an explaination
  
  (this is for explain the selected method of curation) and at least "non automation" beyond less x user usage number
 At page 10 (10*20) => 200 addons later aprox usage is about 50k (50.000 users)
 At page 50 (50*20) => 1000 addons later aprox usage is about 6k (6000 users)
 
 1000 addons and 6000 users as bottom limit (seems fine) to "keep confidence" about archiving "useful addons"
 because logic: "if users ( a decent number don't use an addon, therefore is not useful, good etc)
 
 at page 100 (2000 users) and 2000 addons later (minor addons maybe useful, but non key features i think
 
 At page 200 (aprox 400 users) and 4000 addons later (i dont see much valuable but ith help, we could SaveThem'all hahaha
 At page 300 (aprox 150 users) and 6000 addons later (maybe some gems, which nobody knows has good ideas for new features)
 At page 500 (aprox 30 users per addon, this is low enought to say, addons beyond this dont deserve our time, with exception of abandon but interesting or exceptions "exceptionale" so this would be my limit
 
 Method
 
 I use webScraping and webMining to extract a graph of words and structured data from Mozilla and group addons with keywords in a graph then y design a tree of features and take ideas for example 
  cookies, management, backup, edit, etc 
  password, with tags, sync, keepass, integration
  bookmarks, tags, sync, edit, gui 
  custmization, theme 
  search, engine, backup 
  backup, FEBE, CLEO, OPIE, places, CSV, import, export
  
  
  this is easy, fast and never backup "shit" addons
 
 
 What about addons not listed because mozilla or author kill them (like SearchPlaces, Zotero (the integrated Firefox version, now is standalone) or others like Patch For Library (which is important for me for personal purposes), well, you must reverse search on web archives or MozillaZine, gHacks old news, to retrieve "some useful addons" like Shelve, that masses never know about
 

-Current state of this (document) is imperfect and RAW as RAW meat, but will be updated (cooked) continuously

-DISCLAIMER

This document is produced (now) with voice dictation, Markdown microsyntax with symbols is easy for keyboard but for now not best to add symbols and block delimiters (yeah, that explains the ugly RAW format and disorder), but in terms of productivity this was created on a few minutes (as raw sketch notes), think about it 


I respect author rights as original source code creator open source licenses, credit etc, but NO about "copyright" literal as "distribution" exclusivity => STATEMENT: I reject totally deeply ( add more adjetives here) the logic: "I kill it, I abandon it because it is my creation", "I kill it because it is mine" this is not acceptable for my as some software has unique and useful social value beyond individual selfish reasons

-WIP (non formatted, yet, bad grammar and typos for sure)

-Why? (reason of this)

Mozilla will be (soon) this November-2017 purge XUL support for addons, force "WebExtensions" only (without being a replacer, non-proper mature technology and disrespectul to community devs (veterans, and loyal supporters) => THIS IS A BAD MOVE, Mozilla

-Objectives (focus)

FirefoxPLaces (bookmarks, history) => key features

XUL customization (bars, sliders, sidebars

-Projects ideas-collaboration

ArchiveTeam fellas (help to bulk archive addons, descriptions and source.code) for further analysis and experiments (useful software)
Integration WaterFox team (WaterFox seems solid at least to support a Firefox 53ESR (pre 56-57 build) with XUL-based legacy addons support
Pale Moon (seems outdated or obsolete, more research is needed)

Any fella who wants contribute 


-Sources

Reddit.com (subreddits: Firefox, Mozilla, WaterFox... etc)
Addons.Mozilla.Org (primary source)
Chrome.Webstore (WebExtensions replacers and Chromium|Blink-alternatives)
Www/mirrors
MozillaZine (Firefox powerUsers community)
GHacks for news (seems Martin Brickmann is very interested on Firefox, browsers etc), good source
FEBE => key feature (must be on stable build as internal non an addon!!!)
SearchPlaces => non replacers yet, even Patch For Library (addon) to edit places.uris is deleted by author on addons.mozilla.org
SortPlaces => ...
SyncPlaces => "replacers" as third party sync (EverSync, Xmarks) and Firefox Sync (aka Firefox Accounts, Firefox Weave)
CheckPlaces => partially replaced with Bookmarks-Organizer
TagShifter => TagSieve
Roomy bar
Form History Control
Cookies
-list of HUGE VALUABLE and "Hall Of Fame" addons that would be purged (XUL-based) when Mozilla Firefox 57 build reach stable deploy

FireFTP 
FireSSH 
DownThemAll => authors seems "angry" "preparing silencers" (non literally I suppose) about Mozilla move of deprecating this (and other too

-Repository structure

original (checksum-friendly) XPI last stable versions if addons, extensions, completeThemes as mirrors (personal list, not "complete list" by now)
maybe CSV (name,version,author,Firefox version compatibility) to manage more easy and a Google Docs SpreadSheet to social collaboration


-Examples of authors killing creations (logic: I kill it because i created it)

-Important bugFixes on Firefox places (bookmarks, history)
... be continued

-PERSONAL Opinion

Chromium, Webkit, Firefox, Mozilla, Opera, all main browsers are in hands of "non be evil" companies, corporations, even Mozilla last moves seems the opposite Philosophy of users and devs first (devs are users too) and XUL-addons are used mostly by powerUsers daily and are powerful enought to deserve proper respect, support and replacing before killing them

There is not a browser development powered by a real P2P community (Chromium Waterfox or Mozilla is at the end corporation-driven), all are forks that follow big brother (in all senses), i think would be great if open source community joins to improve the browser development (in terms of code management, compatibility, customization, performance) etc

-KEY though

When I see, Chromium and Chrome force limitation about remember history (90 days or three months old) i have backups but that makes me angry even today (withut proper advice or notice), some see browser history as a "diary of web browsing" and it is useful for agile bookmarking etc (wihout the compulsive star syndrome of push bookmark button million times) that was a key moment, i realize that i want to preserve my data and control expirations, and prevent "SHIT" and "mess" with my things by "smart app" that though for me and decides for me.

Next key moment is when i realize sync services like Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync even Pinboard(interesting) or Xmarks (creepy) make me dependant of third party services, non zero-knowledge, non privacy-friendly and even bad performance, because if you have bookmarks, urls or history ith about 10k order (n*10k) all seems to work bad

But even bookmarking in browsers is bad, eventually i go to self hosted customized web apps, and my own server, but integration with browser is a need for me (visited links mark, bookmarked links mark etc and sync across devices, mobile etc, so internal sync is a need (but i prefer my own hosted like NextCloud, Owncloud than a Xmarks or EverSync, Firefox Sync solution

PD: Initially this is a "mess" as diffuse graph of chaotic thoughs, but eventually will have many sense

-Observation

This document is a expression of some chaos, ideas and thoughs, but chaos tends to relation and order, so check out in a few weeks and see the light (it is a joke, but RAW state will become "state of art" ;)
