# Firefox53ESR-legacy-addons (WIP) created: 2017-10...
-A curated list and XPI files of Mozilla Firefox browser extensions, addons, themes from addons.mozilla.org, before XUL-based purge blackout

-DISCLAIMER

I respect author rights as original source code creator open source licenses, credit etc, but NO about "copyright" literal as "distribution" exclusivity => STATEMENT: I reject totally deeply ( add more adjetives here) the logic: "I kill it, I abandon it because it is my creation", "I kill it because it is mine" this is not acceptable for my as some software has unique and useful social value beyond individual selfish reasons

-WIP (non formatted, yet, bad grammar and typos for sure)

-Why? (reason of this)

Mozilla will be (soon) this November-2017 purge XUL support for addons, force "WebExtensions" only (without being a replacer, non-proper mature technology and disrespectul to community devs (veterans, and loyal supporters) => THIS IS A BAD MOVE, Mozilla

-Objectives (focus)

FirefoxPLaces (bookmarks, history) => key features

XUL customization (bars, sliders, sidebars

-Projects ideas-collaboration

ArchiveTeam fellas (help to bulk archive addons, descriptions and source.code) for further analysis and experiments (useful software)
Integration WaterFox team (WaterFox seems solid at least to support a Firefox 53ESR (pre 56-57 build) with XUL-based legacy addons support
Pale Moon (seems outdated or obsolete, more research is needed)

Any fella who wants contribute
