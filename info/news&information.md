# News & Information 

## SOURCEs

- Mozilla Addons Blog 
- GHacks
- MozillaZine
- AMO (Addons.Mozill.Org)

## KEYs

### XUL and XPCOM deprecated for addons development, without proper replacement (YET), partial incomplete APIs on WebExtensions technology
### AMO after release of Firefo57 will be a legacy software graveyard, a lot of great addons will be permadeath
### If rogue activists or "individuals" like me don't save XPI files and repos, it is most likely to being "purged" after November-2017

## SUPPORT

- For Firefox users, whom use "legacy addons" => they become to tech refugees, my tip is if some addons are key in your workflow, use "Firefox 52 ESR" edition

## Firefox 52 ESR edition and support

## Future after XUL and XPCOM purge:

- If WebExtensions consolidated as "lightweight" addons, then legacy powered-XUL addons core features will be orphans
- If WebExtensions technology implementation on Firefox have core APIs and features of XUL-addons then will be good (even with erratic movements this last years)
- In any case, use Firefox 52 ESR (support until Q2-2018), unti, you replace core features of XUL based addons

## ADDONs "I don't find proper replacer"

- FEBE, CLEO, OPIE backups

## *FOX beyond Mozilla and forks

- Pale Moon => Seems outdated, small team, good ideas, but lacks of resources I think, ego crap involved on source code development
- WaterFox => Seems pretty serious, great idea and maybe even create a parallel community strong Firefox development

- Basilisk => smoke now, maybe change in future (Pale Moon team project)

- IceWeasel => follow Mozilla development, only changes "branding" "logos" and some "cosmetics"
